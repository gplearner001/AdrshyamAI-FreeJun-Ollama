# Next Steps - Diagnose RAG Service

## Current Status

Your backend shows:
```
- VOYAGE_API_KEY: ***53RF ✓ (Key is loaded)
- RAG Service available: False ✗ (Service not working)
```

This means the Voyage API key is being loaded, but something is failing during initialization.

## What I've Added

I've added detailed debug output (print statements) to `rag_service.py` that will show you EXACTLY what's failing.

## Run the Backend Again

Restart your backend server:

```bash
cd backend
python fastapi_app.py
```

## What You Should See Now

When the backend starts, you should see new output like this:

```
[RAG Service] Loading rag_service.py module...
[RAG Service] VOYAGE_AVAILABLE: True/False
[RAG Service] SUPABASE_AVAILABLE: True/False
[RAG Service] Initializing RAGService...
[RAG Service] Voyage API Key found: True/False
[RAG Service] Supabase URL found: True/False
[RAG Service] Supabase Key found: True/False
[RAG Service] Attempting to initialize Voyage AI client...
[RAG Service] ✓ Voyage AI client initialized successfully
  OR
[RAG Service] ✗ Failed to initialize Voyage AI client: <error message>
  OR
[RAG Service] ✗ Cannot initialize Voyage - Available: False, Key: True

[RAG Service] Attempting to initialize Supabase client...
[RAG Service] ✓ Supabase client initialized successfully
  OR
[RAG Service] ✗ Failed to initialize Supabase client: <error message>
  OR
[RAG Service] ✗ Cannot initialize Supabase - Available: False, URL: True, Key: True

[RAG Service] ===== Initialization Complete =====
[RAG Service] Available: True/False
[RAG Service]   - Voyage Client: True/False
[RAG Service]   - Supabase Client: True/False
```

## Interpreting the Output

### If you see: `VOYAGE_AVAILABLE: False`

**Problem:** The `voyageai` package is not installed

**Fix:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install voyageai
# or
python3 -m pip install voyageai
```

### If you see: `SUPABASE_AVAILABLE: False`

**Problem:** The `supabase` package is not installed

**Fix:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install supabase
# or
python3 -m pip install supabase
```

### If you see: `✗ Failed to initialize Voyage AI client: <error>`

**Problem:** The Voyage API key is invalid or there's an API error

**Fix:**
- Check if the API key is correct
- Verify the key hasn't expired
- Try generating a new key from voyageai.com

### If you see: `✗ Failed to initialize Supabase client: <error>`

**Problem:** Supabase connection failed

**Fix:**
- Verify the Supabase URL is correct
- Verify the Supabase Anon Key is correct
- Check if your Supabase project is active

### If you see: `Cannot initialize Voyage - Available: True, Key: False`

**Problem:** The VOYAGE_API_KEY environment variable is not being loaded

**Fix:**
- Ensure `backend/.env` exists
- Verify the file has `VOYAGE_API_KEY=<your key>`
- Restart the backend server

## Alternative Diagnostic Test

You can also run the diagnostic script I created:

```bash
cd backend
python3 test_rag_service.py
```

This will show you detailed information about:
- Environment variables
- Package imports
- Client initialization
- RAG service status

## What to Report Back

After restarting the backend, please share:

1. The full `[RAG Service]` output lines
2. Specifically which step is failing:
   - `VOYAGE_AVAILABLE: False` → Package not installed
   - `SUPABASE_AVAILABLE: False` → Package not installed
   - `Failed to initialize Voyage AI client` → API key issue
   - `Failed to initialize Supabase client` → Supabase connection issue
   - `Cannot initialize` → Missing environment variable

This will tell us exactly what needs to be fixed!

## Most Common Issue

Based on typical scenarios, the most likely issue is:

**Missing Python packages**

Run this to fix:
```bash
cd backend
pip install voyageai supabase tiktoken
```

Then restart the backend server.

## Summary

The debug output will now show you exactly what's failing. Once you run the backend and see the new `[RAG Service]` messages, we can pinpoint the exact issue and fix it.
